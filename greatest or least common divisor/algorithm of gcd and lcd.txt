algorithm of gcd function

step 1: take n and m as input.(we are considering 2 number now and m > n)
step 2: if m % n == 0 go to step 4.
step 3: replace max number between m and n with (max_number_between_m_y % min_number_between_m_y). check if min number can
	be dividable with max number return min number and go to step 4. else repeat step 3.
step 4: min number is the gcd.

algorithm of lcd function,
 n X m = gcd X lcd.
so find gcd then find lcd from it
